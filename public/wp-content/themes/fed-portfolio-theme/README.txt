After theme activation, head on over to the Pages section in your Dashboard and click 'Add New '.
Choose the template called 'Landing-page' and hit Save Draft.
Give the page the title 'Landing' and go on fill the 'Landing-info' and 'About info' text-fields
with your appropriate information.
Next up is the skills section. Here you can add up to four skills and choose a percentage for 
your mastering level.
You can also add a heading text for your skills.
When done, hit the Publish-button. You have now created the only page needed for your portfolio!

Now, you'll also need to assign it as your wordpress start-page. To do so, navigate to Settings 
-> Reading. Set the radio to the 'A static page' -option and in the dropdown for Front page 
select your previously created page called 'Landing' and hit Save Changes.

You'll now be able to see some changes on your site! Your name, title and about-info showing up 
and also your skills smoothly animated. Neat! But still we have more to do.

Head on over to the Appearance -> Menus. Her you'll find an already built menu for your page. 
All we gotta do now is assign it to your page. Do so by ticking the box 'Animated left menu' in 
the Theme locations options and hit save menu.
Now you've got a menu on your page enabling smooth scrolling between your page's different areas.

To further personalize your portfolio-site, check out the Users section in your Dashboard. Here 
you'll find yourself listed.
Click your name and provide the information you want listed under Contact Info. 
This information will be used as contact links in the menu on your site, so be sure to fill out 
the correct information or else noone will be able to give you a shout.

To be able to display an image of your beautiful appearance on the site, you'll have to follow 
the provided link to Gravatar.
Set up an account there using the same email you've used when installing you Wordpress site and 
upload a picture of yourself there. It only takes a minute so it's totally worth it.

When assigning the theme your dashboard also recieved a new option to create Portfolios. 
Choose that tab in your dashboard and hit Add New to start creating a new Portfolio post to your
page. 
Start of by giving it a title. The topmost title is only used for your Dashboard, while the 
Project Title will be used for display on your site.
Go on and fill out a short description of the project, add the technologies you used and provide
a valid url (ex. http://myawesomeproject.com).
You can also add an image to your project by choosing 'Set cover image' in the 'Portfolio Cover 
Image' -area. When done, hit Publish and have a look at your site which now displays a link to 
your added portfolio project and animates the content upon clicking it.

If you wanna add a personal favicon to your site, simply replace the file called 'favicon.png' 
in the themes img directory with your own picture.

Now, yoo're all set! Keep adding portfolios for all your amazing projects!
